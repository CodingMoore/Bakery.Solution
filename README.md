Project Initiated: 2020-12-11<br>

## **Project Description**
This project is a console-based user interface for purchasing various baked goods.  When the program prject is initiated, the user is greeted and offerd several menu choices.  The user is free to navigate the menus and update their shopping cart with the goods that they wish to purchase.

Since the bakery is having a sale, prices are calculated based on how many of each type of product are in the cart.  Bread is noramally $5 a loaf, but is "Buy 2 get one free".  Pastries are normally $2 each, but you can get 3 for $5. The price of all goods, including the sale prices, are continuously tallied for the user.  If the user has earned a free loaf of bread but has not added it to their cart, the user is notified at the time of the purchase.

This is my first solo c# project, and is an exercise in coding using C# and .NET, using Test Driven Development, classes, getters and setters, apropriate file structures, etc.
